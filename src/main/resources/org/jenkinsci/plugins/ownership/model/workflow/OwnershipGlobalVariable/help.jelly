<div>
 Provides ownership info for different item types.
 <p/>
 Currently the macro supports retrieval of ownership info for jobs and nodes only.
 It can be done via the nested variables:
<dl>
  <dt>ownership.job</dt>
  <dd>
    Job ownership info.
    This info may be inherited from parent folders.
  </dd>
  <dt>ownership.node</dt>
  <dd>
    Node ownership info. 
    The expression must be used within the <code>node()</code> Pipeline block.
    Otherwise the command will throw an exception.
   </dd>
 </dl>
 
 Each call returns a structure, which provides the following fields:
 <dl>
   <dt>ownershipEnabled</dt>
   <dd>Indicates that ownership is configured for the item. 
     Type: <code>boolean</code>.
   </dd>
   
   <dt>ownerId</dt>
   <dd>
     User ID of the item owner. 
     Type: <code>java.lang.String</code>.
   </dd>
   
   <dt>ownerEmail</dt>
   <dd>
     Email of the item owner. Type: <code>java.lang.String</code>.
   </dd>
   
   <dt>coOwnerIds</dt>
   <dd>
     Collection of the item co-owner user IDs (does not include the item owner). 
     Type: <code>java.util.Set&lt;String&gt;</code>.
   </dd>
   
   <dt>coOwnerEmails</dt>
   <dd>Collection of the item co-owner e-mails (does not include the item owner). 
     Type: <code>java.util.Set&lt;String&gt;</code>.
   </dd>
 </dl>

    Usage example:
   
    stage 'Print Job Ownership Info';
    def ownerEmail = ownership.job.ownerEmail
    if (ownership.job.ownershipEnabled) {
      println "Owner ID: ${ownership.job.ownerId}"
      println "Owner e-mail: ${ownerEmail}"
      println "Co-owner IDs: ${ownership.job.coOwnerIds}"
      println "Co-owner e-mails: ${ownership.job.coOwnerEmails}"
    } else {
      println "Ownership is disabled";
    }
    
    stage 'Send e-mail to the job owner'
    mail to: ownerEmail,
      subject: "Job '${env.JOB_NAME}' (${env.BUILD_NUMBER}) is waiting for input",
      body: "Please go to ${env.BUILD_URL} and verify the build"
