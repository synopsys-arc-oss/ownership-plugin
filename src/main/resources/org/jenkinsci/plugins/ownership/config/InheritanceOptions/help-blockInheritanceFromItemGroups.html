    Blocks ownership inheritance from item groups like 
    <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Folders+Plugin">Folders</a> or 
    <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Multi-Branch+Project+Plugin">Multi-branch projects</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default the plugin inherits ownership info from upper items.
    Such inheritance may impact the performance of the Jenkins instance (especially 
    <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Ownership-Based+security">Ownership-based security</a>), 
    hence it is possible to disable it.
